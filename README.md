# Ingress Excubitor: Client

This is the Android client app for Ingress Excubitor. Not much more to say, at the moment.

## What is Excubitor?

Excubitor is a helper application for Ingress, to manage your "entities destroyed" emails.

**Step 1:** Register your Google account on the site, so it can associate the incoming emails with you.

**Step 2:** Download and install the Android client, and set up your account.

**Step 3:** Set up your GMail (or other email) account to automatically forward all "entities destroyed" emails to the service.

**Step 4:** Wait for someone to destroy one or more of your resonators/links/fields.

## Why the name?

Excubitor is Latin for "sentinel" or "watchman". It's pronounced ex-OOH-bit-or.
